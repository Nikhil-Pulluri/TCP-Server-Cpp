# TCP-Server-Cpp

This project demonstrates the implementation of a basic TCP server using C++. The server communicates with a client application, providing options to access a database, perform calculations, or exit.

## Client-Server Interaction

The client interacts with the server by selecting one of three available options:

1. Data Base: Access and manage data stored in the database
2. Calculator: Perform mathematical calculations
3. Exit: Terminate the connection with the server

Upon selecting an option, the client receives a corresponding response from the server.

## Screenshot

The provided screenshot captures the execution of the code on both the server and client sides.
